                <p class="langar"><font color="white">My name is Nur Khaliesah binti Kamaruzaman. I am 21 years old and a final semester diploma student at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Kelantan Branch. I was born on January 2, 1999 at Zainab General Hospital (II) in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. I have four siblings and am the second child in the family. I started school at the age of 5 at a kindergarten, KEMAS Kindergarten. I went to primary school at Sekolah Kebangasaan Zainab (1) and I also continued my studies at a secondary school, Sekolah Kebangsaan Sultan Ismail (SMKSI).I have a happy family. I am very thankful to God because my life is complete with the presence of people who are called father, mother, sister, and brother who make up my family. Dad and mom are the individuals I love and respect the most in my life. Although sometimes I fail to follow their orders and make mistakes, they still love me and advise me and always hope for the best for me.</p></font>
                <br>



                <p class="langar"><font color="white">I also have a sister and two sisters a girl and a boy. My sister is 24 years old and my sisters are 17 and 16 years old respectively. We have been well educated by both our parents. If we make a mistake, my father will advise us in a good way and never punish us. My siblings and I can be said to be individuals who have a stubborn or stubborn attitude. However, if viewed from a positive perspective, we can be considered as individuals who stand firm.Besides, I am a very confident person. I am confident that I will be able to do my best in whatever task is done if it is performed in the right way and accompanied by hard work. In addition, prayer is also a factor in one's success. Therefore, every effort taken must be embroidered with prayer and high commitment.</p></font>

                <p class="langar"><font color="white">I like to do my tasks systematically. Therefore, I will carry out my daily activities based on the daily schedule that I have prepared. It also helps me manage time wisely because I always know what I need to do at certain times. Therefore, I can avoid wasting time. Furthermore, good time management is very important to me who bears the responsibility as a student.In my spare time, I enjoy reading books. Among the reading materials I chose were novels, magazines, and fiction books. I love reading because I get satisfaction when reading. In addition, I really like surfing the internet and reading to gather information about professional careers that I may be involved in later. I want to know more about a career before venturing into it so that I will be able to make decisions according to my interests.</p></font>
                <br>

                <p class="langar"><font color="white">I am interested in the field of information technology and aspire to be a library director in the future. I am an ambitious person. I want to be a knowledgeable person so that I will be able to achieve success in life and will always be respected.</p></font>
