            My father's name is Kamaruzaman Bin Kamaruddin, he is 55 years old. My father is strong and firm. His friend called him "Kamal". My father was a clerk in the private sector. Every morning, he went to his office after breakfast and returned at the appointed time. Each night, Dad would set a time for us to review the lessons. That's when he will check our school work. We can only watch television after finishing all the school work. My father is a friendly and helpful person. When neighbors or villagers need help, the father is sure, will help them. My father loves us very much. When he has free time, he will definitely take us as a family to travel to the resorts. I feel lucky to have a responsible, kind and friendly father. I am so grateful to my father for giving me a happy life.
