<h2> About me</h2>
<p>Khaliesah's resume uses photos to tell her personal story and it reads kind of like a cool, digital scrapbook. It covers all the bases of a resume and then some by discussing her educational background, work experience, and skills in a highly visual way.</p>

<p>Not to mention, the copy is fantastic. It's clear that Khaliesah took the time to carefully choose the right words to describe each step of her personal and professional journey.</p>
